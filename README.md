# Monty-Hall-Game
Very quick code snippet to empirically check which strategy is the best when confronted with a Monty Hall problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).  

As expected, the second strategy is the best out of the three following strategies:  
 1 - Do not change your door after one of the fake doors has been opened (*33% winrate*).  
 2 - Change your door after one of the fake doors has been opened (*66% winrate*).  
 3 - Change or keep your door randomly after one of the fake doors has been opened (*50% winrate*).  
 
 
 FAQ:  
- **Is it useless?**\yes.   
- **Did I just do it out of scepticism to a youtube video I just watched?**\also yes.
